# SparkFlinkComparison
This repository has source code from a comparative work between the streaming processing frameworks: Apache Spark and Apache Flink. 
This comparative evaluation was developed in the final work of the Specialization in Data Intelligence oriented to Big Data of the National University of La Plata, Argentina.

The objective of this work is to make a comparison between the two previously mentioned frameworks. The comparative study will be carried out from several points of view, among them:
• Ease of installation and deployment;
• Supported sources for data exchange;
• Supported programming languages;
• Documentation available;
•	Performance evaluation.
To make the comparison between these tools, the Python development language will be used, since it supports work in both Spark and Flink, and in turn is one of the most used programming languages today.
